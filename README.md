twitter part 2

favorite shouldve worked with swift 4.2 tried to code the .state.normal() swift 4 version of it but could not get it to work
commented out the code which includes with the code needed to work with favorite so if it wasnt for my outdated version
the code should have worked fine by changing it back to how that line of code was in the tutorial
